1: An Atwood machine is brought to the moon with 1/6 earth's gravity., The masses will accelerate faster than Earth,*The masses will accelerate slower than Earth, The masses will not accelerate, The acceleration will be the same as Earth
2: Which set of masses will produce the greatest acceleration?,*0.5 kg and 1.0 kg, 1.0 kg and 1.5 kg, 1.5 kg and 2.0 kg, 2.0 kg and 2.5 kg
3: What does negative acceleration mean?,*Acceleration up (left weight),Acceleration down (left weight),Does not exist,Does not matter
4: If mass 1=2.7 kg mass 2=3.1 kg. Acceleration=,3.2 N/kg,1.12 N/kg,*-1.12 N/kg,-3.2 N/kg
5: Some Question,*right,wrong,wrong,wrong
6:Another question,wrong,wrong,wrong,*right
7: Some Question,wrong,wrong,*right,wrong
8:Another question,wrong,*right,wrong,wrong
